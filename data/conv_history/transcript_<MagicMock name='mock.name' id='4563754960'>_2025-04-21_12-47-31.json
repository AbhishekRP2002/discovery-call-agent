Does that timeframe still work for you?\n\nMy goal today is primarily to learn more about your current processes, challenges, and goals at Broadcom, Inc., especially regarding sales intelligence and outreach, to see if there might be a potential fit for Apollo.io. If it makes sense, we can discuss appropriate next steps towards the end. How does that sound?\n"
