conversational voice agent:

- handling context for throughout the conversation
- think about adding fallback in STT and TTS models, if fallback is used then how to ensure consistency in voice
- personalized intro message:
  - use the form input to craft a personalised welcome message

pass the prospect information, prospect company info,

seller company info.


Issues / improvement scope:

- TTS model reading the markdown representation characters in middle of conversation like (**Regeneration** as `asterisks asterisks regeneration asterisks asterisks`  )
- voice is robotic, taking pauses in between, flow is not smooth
- greetings, redirecting to seller company information.
